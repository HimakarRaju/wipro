# Write a detailed pseudocode for a simple program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's even or the cube if it's odd, and then outputs the result. Incorporate conditional and looping constructs.

# **Program: Calculate Square or Cube**

number = int(input("Enter a number : "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    result = number ** 2
else:
    result = number ** 3
print(result)
