# Question1  Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

**Question:2 Write a program that asks the user for their first and last name, and then prints them in reverse order with a space between them.

**Example:**

```
Input: John Doe
Output: eoD nhoJ
```

**Question:3  Write a program that takes a list of integers and an integer as input from the user. Check if the integer is present in the list. If it is, print the index of its first occurrence. If it is not, print a message saying the integer is not in the list.

**Question:4  Write a program that takes a dictionary of student names and their grades. Print the student with the highest grade.

**Example:**

```python
students = {"Alice": 88, "Bob": 95, "Charlie": 90}
Output: Bob
```

**Question:5  Write a program that takes a list of tuples representing student names and their grades, and prints a set of students who scored more than 75.

**Example:**

```python
students = [("Alice", 88), ("Bob", 72), ("Charlie", 90)]
Output: {'Alice', 'Charlie'}
```

**Question:6  Write a program that reads a file called "input.txt" and prints its contents line by line. If the file does not exist, print a message saying the file could not be found.

**Question:7  Write a program that takes a string as input from the user and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

**Example:**
Input: hello world
Output: 3
**Question:8 Write a program that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. Use a list comprehension for this task.

**Example:**

```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [2, 4, 6]

Question 9: Write a program that takes a list of dictionaries (each dictionary representing a student with "name" and "grades" keys) and prints the average grade of each student.
